# Objective 
# In this challenge, we review some basic concepts that will get you 
# started with this series. You will need to use the same (or similar)
#  syntax to read input and write output in challenges throughout HackerRank. 
# Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!
#
# Task 
# To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a 
# variable, print Hello, World. on a single line, and finally print the value of your 
# variable on a second line.
# 
# You've got this!
# 
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Read a full line of input from stdin and save it to our dynamically typed variable, input_string.
input_string = input()

# Print a string literal saying "Hello, World." to stdout.
print('Hello, World.')

# TODO: Write a line of code here that prints the contents of input_string to stdout.
print(input_string)
